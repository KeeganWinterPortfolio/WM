          The Origin of Y Ddraig Goch
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-justify">
          As we trace the footsteps of the red dragon, we find ourselves
          venturing deep into the labyrinth of time, to a period steeped in
          magic and the supernatural. The origins of Y Ddraig Goch are as
          elusive as they are captivating, wrapped in a tapestry of tales passed
          down through generations.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In the Arthurian narrative, the legendary magician Merlin envisages a
          fierce battle between a red and a white dragon beneath the King
          Vortigern's troubled fortress. The red dragon, representing the Welsh,
          eventually triumphs over the white dragon, symbolic of the invading
          Saxons. This prophecy, while steeped in myth, resonates with the
          historical struggles of the Welsh against various invaders.

          Y Ddraig Goch - A Symbol of Resilience
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg text-justify">
          The story of Y Ddraig Goch is not merely a tale of fire and fury but
          also a symbol of resilience. It mirrors the relentless spirit of Wales
          that refused to be quenched despite the ebbs and flows of history.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          As the red dragon roared victory in the prophecy of Merlin, so too did
          the Welsh rise time and again, demonstrating their resilience against
          formidable foes. Y Ddraig Goch came to embody this fighting spirit,
          serving as a rallying emblem that united the Welsh throughout their
          turbulent history.

          Y Ddraig Goch on the Flag of Wales
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg text-justify">
          A question often asked is why the red dragon found its place on the
          national flag of Wales. It was King Henry VII, the first monarch of
          the House of Tudor, who formalized the use of the Red Dragon symbol.
          Descending from a Welsh lineage, the King used the emblem during the
          Battle of Bosworth Field, which he won, marking the end of the Wars of
          the Roses.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In 1959, Queen Elizabeth II granted the red dragon official status,
          forever solidifying its position on the flag. It has since flown high
          and proud, a testament to the undying spirit of Wales.
